<h1>Pixabay API</h1>

This exercise is from an Udemy course. 

It involves a lot of fundamentals such as functions, classes, props, state, setState and map. 

It is interesting to learn different ways of doing things since this way it was very different from the way I learned at Ironhack. New concepts such as super(props) and .bind   

It uses Axios to fetch data from the API and Semantic UI as basic styling.

Let's do this :)
