<h1>Exercises</h1>

Been working on some exercises since March of 2021.

Since the end of the bootcamp in August, been dividing my time between reviewing JavaScript basics, solving katas at Codewars, reviewing bootcamp materials, learning SQL and watching lessons of a few new purchased courses on Udemy (React, React Native and Vue).
