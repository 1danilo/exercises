<h1>Exercises</h1>

Exercises I have been working on since the beginning of my journey.

Since the end of the bootcamp, been dividing my time between reviewing JavaScript basics, reviewing bootcamp materials, learning SQL and watching lessons of a few new purchased courses on Udemy (React, React Native and Angular).
